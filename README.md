## Synopsis

A set of tools for processing XML documents into formats that can be loaded
into Neo4J.  In general, we want to take the tree structure that the XML
presents, and load it into neo4j as-is, permitting analysts to then use
Cypher queries to massage/reformat that data from the XML structure into
whatever is needed.

## Quick Start

TBD
